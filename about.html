        <li>Remaining matches tells you how many mathches is left</li>
        <li>Current position is basically your accuracy percentage out of 43 cars</li>
        <ul>
            <li>if you have good accuracy in matching the cards the more better your position is</li>
            <li>ex. First Place is 100% accuracy and 43th is 0% accuracy </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>first lap is a practice lap then it would increment from there</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Current Lap Time is your elapse time from that lap</li>
